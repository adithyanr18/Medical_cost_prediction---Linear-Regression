# Medical_cost_prediction---Linear-Regression

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates an end-to-end machine learning workflow using linear regression to predict insurance-related charges. It focuses on exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation using Python and scikit-learn.

The goal of the project is to understand how different input features influence a continuous target variable and to evaluate the effectiveness of linear models for regression problems.
